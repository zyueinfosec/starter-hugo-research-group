      - title: SePAL
        content: The term "sepal" typically refers to one of the leaf-like structures that protect and support the petals of a flower. Sepals are typically green and enclose and protect the flower bud before it blooms. **"SePAL"** is a creative and metaphorical name that draws an analogy between the protective function of sepals in flowers and the protective function of our security lab in the realm of information privacy and security.
