Yue Zhang is an assistant professor at Drexel University’s Computer Science department. Before joining Drexel, Yue Zhang was working as a Postdoc in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University. His research primarily focuses on system security, specifically in the areas of IoT Security and mobile security. He has published more than 40 papers in security conferences (e.g., USENIX Security, ACM CCS, and NDSS) and journals (e.g., TDSC, TPDS). He received a Best Paper Honorable Mention Award at ACM CCS 2022, and the Best Paper Award at 2019 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Internet. He has also served on the organization committees of the conferences (e.g., track chair for IEEE MSN) and technical program committee of the conferences (e.g., USENIX Security, NDSS, ACM CCS, RAID). He serves as an editor for the Blockchain Journal, Electronics Journal, and Computers, Materials & Continua Journal. His research had led to the discovery of many vendor-acknowledged vulnerabilities, such as by Bluetooth SIG, Apple, Google, and Texas Instruments, and had attracted intense media attention such as Hacker News, and Mirage News.
